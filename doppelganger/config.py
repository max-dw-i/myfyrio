    '''Represent config containing programme's preferences. The config is a
    dictionary with the keys:

        size:               int - size (width or height) of image thumbnails,
        show_similarity:    bool - show (or not) the similarity rates
                            of duplicate images,
        show_size:          bool - show (or not) the sizes of duplicate images,
        show_path:          bool - show (or not) the paths of duplicate images,
        sort:               int - sorting type (duplicate images in every group
                            can be sorted),
        delete_dirs:        bool - delete (or not) empty directories when
                            duplicate images are moved or deleted,
        size_format:        int - duplicate image size format (bytes,
                            kilobytes...),
        subfolders:         bool - search through the directories recursively
                            (or not),
        close_confirmation: bool - ask the user confirmation when he/she
                            closes the programme,
        filter_img_size:    bool - search for duplicate images only among
                            the images with the specific width and height,
        min_width:          int - if "filter_img_size" is True, the min width
                            of images,
        max_width:          int - if "filter_img_size" is True, the max width
                            of images,
        min_height:         int - if "filter_img_size" is True, the min height
                            of images,
        max_height:         int - if "filter_img_size" is True, the max height
                            of images,
        cores:              int - number of CPU cores to use,
        lazy:               bool - use lazy thumbnail loading (or not),
        sensitivity:        int - threshold used when images are compared to
                            find out whether they are similar or not

    The dictionary is kept in the attribute "data"
